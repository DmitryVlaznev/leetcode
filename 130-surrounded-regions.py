# 130. Surrounded Regions

# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all
# regions surrounded by 'X'.

# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
# region.

# Example:

# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After running your function, the board should be:

# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
# Explanation:

# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any
# 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is
# not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will
# be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells
# connected horizontally or vertically.
