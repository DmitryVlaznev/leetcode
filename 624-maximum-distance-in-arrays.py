# 624. Maximum Distance in Arrays

# Given m arrays, and each array is sorted in ascending order. Now you
# can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks
# one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two
# integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a-b|. Your task is
# to find the maximum distance.

# Example 1:
# Input:
# [[1,2,3],
#  [4,5],
#  [1,2,3]]
# Output: 4

# Explanation:
# One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or
# third array and pick 5 in the second array.

# Note:
# Each given array will have at least 1 number. There will be at least
# two non-empty arrays.
# The total number of the integers in all the m arrays will be in the
# range of [2, 10000].
# The integers in the m arrays will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
