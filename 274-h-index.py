# 274. H-Index

# Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
# of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
# index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
# the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example:
# Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
# Output: 3

# Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total
#              and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations
#              respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at
#              least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
#              than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

# Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is
# taken as the h-index.
