# 275. H-Index II

# Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation
# is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to
# compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
# index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
# the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example:
# Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total
#              and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations
#              respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at
#              least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
#              than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

# Note:
# If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken
# as the h-index.

# Follow up:
# This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now
# guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
# Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
