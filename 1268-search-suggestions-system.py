# 1268. Search Suggestions System

# Medium

# Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to
# design a system that suggests at most three product names from
# products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested
# products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are
# more than three products with a common prefix return the three
# lexicographically minimums products.

# Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of
# searchWord is typed.


# Example 1:
# Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
# Output: [
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"]
# ]
# Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
# After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
# After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]

# Example 2:
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
# Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]

# Example 3:
# Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
# Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]

# Example 4:
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
# Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]

# Constraints:
# 1 <= products.length <= 1000
# There are no repeated elements in products.
# 1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
# All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
# All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
